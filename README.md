# TravelAware — Flight and Hotel Review App

TravelAware is an app designed to help travelers discover and review flights and hotels with ease. Whether you’re planning a weekend getaway or a multi-city adventure, TravelAware provides a streamlined way to browse reviews, share experiences, and make informed booking decisions.

_This project is currently a work in progress._
